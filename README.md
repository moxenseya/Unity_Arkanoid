# Unity - Arkanoid
Arkanoid is an arcade game released by Taito in 1986. It expanded upon Atari's Breakout games of the 1970s by adding power-ups, different types of bricks, a variety of level layouts, and more sculpted, layered visuals. The title refers to a doomed mother ship from which the player's ship, the Vaus, escapes. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkanoid)
